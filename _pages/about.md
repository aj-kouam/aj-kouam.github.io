I am a researcher (starting researcher position) in the [TRIBE team](https://team.inria.fr/tribe/) at Inria Saclay, working on the national [PEPR MOBIDEC](https://pepr-mobidec.fr/) project. I am also finalizing a postdoc at TU Berlin in the [Machine Learning and Security](https://mlsec.org/) group led by [Prof. Konrad Rieck](https://mlsec.org/team/rieck/index.html).

I completed my PhD at Inria Saclay and École Polytechnique under the supervision of [Aline Carneiro Viana](http://pages.saclay.inria.fr/aline.viana/) and [Alain Tchana](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alain.tchana/), followed by an 8-month postdoc at Inria.

My research focuses on machine learning for security and privacy, with particular interest in user-centered analysis, attack and defense mechanisms, and data-driven techniques in mobile communications.

During my PhD, I interned at [Telecom Paris](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philippe-Martins) (cellular signaling in a Faraday cage) and at [CNR Pisa](https://lucapappalardo.com/) (modeling CDRs/XDRs).

I hold a degree in computer engineering (2019) from the École Polytechnique of Yaoundé, Cameroon.

**Research interests**: Mobile network security & privacy, AI for communication systems, user modeling, attack detection & prevention.
