I am a researcher (starting researcher position) in the [TRIBE team](https://team.inria.fr/tribe/) at Inria Saclay, working on the national [PEPR MOBIDEC](https://pepr-mobidec.fr/) project. I am also a visiting researcher at TU Berlin, where I completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the [Machine Learning and Security](https://mlsec.org/) group led by [Prof. Konrad Rieck](https://mlsec.org/team/rieck/index.html).

I earned my PhD from Inria Saclay and École Polytechnique, under the supervision of [Aline Carneiro Viana](http://pages.saclay.inria.fr/aline.viana/) and [Alain Tchana](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alain.tchana/), and subsequently held a short postdoc at Inria.
My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, security, and privacy, with a particular focus on user-centered analysis, attack and defense strategies, and data-driven methods in mobile communication systems.

During my PhD, I conducted research internships at [Telecom Paris](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philippe-Martins) (cellular signaling experiments in a Faraday cage) and at [CNR Pisa](https://lucapappalardo.com/) (modeling and realistic generation of CDR/XDR data). I hold a degree in computer engineering (2019) from École Polytechnique of Yaoundé, Cameroon.

**Research interests**: Mobile network security & privacy, AI for communication systems, user modeling, attack detection & prevention.
