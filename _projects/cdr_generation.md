To overcome the privacy and accessibility limitations of real-world mobile datasets, we developed **Zen**, the first framework to synthesize realistic Call Detail Records (CDRs) that jointly model human mobility and traffic behaviors. Zen simulates urban mobility using enhanced Working Day Mobility (En-WDM) models, integrates social interactions, and leverages LSTM-based generative models to produce realistic app usage and call activity.

A key innovation is the **explicit modeling of the mutual influence between mobility and traffic**, enabling the generation of user-level behaviors that mirror real-world heterogeneity. Zen also allows control over dataset scale and duration, making it a flexible tool for network simulation, privacy research, and urban mobility analysis.

      <strong>Figure.</strong> Our model outperforms classical statistical baselines by reproducing the real-world diversity of user behaviors, especially in traffic burstiness and temporal dynamics. It accurately captures inter-user differences across both weekday and weekend usage.
